<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RakanAlanazi/CodEx/gh-pages/images/interface.png" width="600" height="400" />

An interactive, web-based visualization tool that enables a top-down and bottom-up analysis of a system 
and its execution paths for an enhanced program comprehension experience. The tool implements the execution path mining along with the visualization aspects.
It can automatically analyze the source file of a system and construct the static call graph for a system. Then, cluster the execution paths of the call graph into hierarchical abstractions. The tool also lets the users visualize the structure of the system in multi-level abstractions. Moreover, it provides different features including filtering, search, and quantitative information to aid the comprehension process.
